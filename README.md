# PREDICT STATE OF HEALTH (SOH) AND REMAINING USEFUL LIFE (RUL) LITHIUM-ION BATTERY USING MACHINE LEARNING

## üéØ Key Features & Contributions

- **Systematic Comparison:** Detailed evaluation and comparison of the performance of three leading families of ensemble machine learning algorithms:
  - **Bagging** (using Random Forest)
  - **Boosting** (using XGBoost)
  - **Stacking** (using RF, XGB, SVR and GPR as base-learners and Ridge Regression as the meta-learner)
- **Robust Feature Selection:** A rigorous exhaustive search process combined with Leave-One-Battery-Out (LOBO) cross-validation was implemented to identify the optimal feature subset, balancing predictive performance with practical applicability.

- **Rigorous Evaluation:** The LOBO cross-validation method is used to provide an objective and reliable estimate of the model's generalization ability across different battery cells.

- **Focus on Practicality:** All selected features are derived from basic measurement data (Current, Voltage, Temperature), making the proposed models suitable for practical deployment on commercial Battery Management Systems (BMS).
